**Full-Stack Developer Assignment: Mock Service and CRUD Operations Project Overview:**

You are required to develop a simple web application that simulates a **user management system**. The application will have both a **frontend** and a **backend**. For the purposes of this assignment**, the backend will be mocked**.

**Frontend**:

Develop a React application using Material-UI for styling.

The application should have the following pages:

1.  User List Page: Display a list of users.
2.  User Detail Page: Show detailed information for a selected user.
3.  User Creation Page: A form to add a new user.
4.  User Edit Page: A form to edit existing user information.



**Backend (Mock)**:

Instead of a real backend, use msw (Mock Service Worker) to mock API responses. The API should support the following CRUD operations:

1.  Create: Add a new user.
2.  Read: Get a list of users and get details for a specific user.
3.  Update: Update user information.
4.  Delete: Remove a user.



**Testing**:

Write unit tests for your components using Vitest. Ensure to test critical functionalities, including form submissions and API interactions.



**Assignment Requirements:**

**  


**1. Frontend Development**:

Implement the user interface as described, ensuring it is responsive and user-friendly. Use React with Functional Components and Hooks.

Manage state using React Context API or any state management library of your choice.



**2. API Mocking:**

Use msw to mock the backend.

Define handlers for each CRUD operation.

Ensure that the mocked API behaves as close to a real API as possible.



**3. Testing**:

Write comprehensive tests for your application. Your tests should cover key functionalities and components.



**4. Documentation**:

Provide a README file explaining how to set up and run your application and tests. Document any assumptions or decisions you made during development.



**5. Submission**:

Submit your code via a Git repository link. Ensure your code is well-organized and commented where necessary.



**6. Evaluation Criteria**:

Code quality and best practices in both **frontend** and **backend** development.

Effective use of the specified tools and libraries.

The correctness of CRUD operations and how well they are mocked.

The quality and coverage of tests.

Adherence to the requirements and completeness of the application.
